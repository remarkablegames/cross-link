# Cross-Link

🔗 Connect the dots. Cross the lines.

<kbd>Cross-Link</kbd> is a puzzle game about connections — drawing lines between matching stars to form constellations, then crossing those lines to make them vanish. Each level is a star map waiting to be untangled: pair up the dots, weave your lines across each other, and watch the night sky clear one crossing at a time.

Play the game on:

- [itch.io](https://remarkablegames.itch.io/cross-link)
- [remarkablegames](https://remarkablegames.org/cross-link/)

## How to Play

1. **Connect the dots** – Tap a colored star, then tap another star of the same color to draw a line between them.
2. **Cross to clear** – When two or more lines cross, all connected pairs disappear. The goal is to clear all stars from the board.
3. **Plan your moves** – The order in which you connect pairs matters. Think ahead to create crossings that clear multiple pairs at once.
4. **Deselect** – Tap a selected star again to cancel, or tap anywhere else on the screen.
